  <h1>First Feedback</h1>

  <p>
    Receiving feedback for the first time in an academic setting can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. 
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most valuable lessons I learned from this feedback was the importance of clear communication and proper documentation. Even if your code or project is well-executed, presenting it in an organized and understandable manner makes a huge difference in how it is perceived by peers and instructors.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also learned to separate myself from my work and view feedback objectively. At first, criticism can feel personal, but I realized that itâ€™s intended to help me grow. By embracing feedback, I was able to improve not just my technical skills, but also my teamwork, presentation, and problem-solving abilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The process of receiving feedback helped me develop resilience and a growth mindset. I started to seek feedback actively rather than waiting for evaluations. This proactive approach has allowed me to continuously refine my skills and build confidence in my abilities.
