  <h1>My Programming Experience</h1>

  <p>
    Ever since high school, I have been fascinated by programming. I started with C++ and it helped me understand core concepts such as logic, problem-solving, and structured thinking, which are essential skills for any aspiring software engineer.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    I also collaborated with classmates on group programming assignments, which taught me the importance of teamwork, code versioning, and peer review. These experiences gave me a taste of what professional software development looks like and how to work effectively in a team.
  </p>

  <p>
 I realized that programming is not just about writing code—it’s about thinking logically, solving problems, and creating efficient solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, my programming experience has been both challenging and rewarding. It confirmed my passion for technology and motivated me to pursue a career in ICT, where I can continue learning, building, and contributing to meaningful projects.
